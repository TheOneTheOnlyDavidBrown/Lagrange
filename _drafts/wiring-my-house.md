I'll admit it - wireless is more convienent for mobile devices. But that convenience comes at the cost of speed. I decided to wire my house because I have a desktop and a home office that rely on the web and both speed and reliability are crucial.

My Internet speed is 100 mbps and hard wired into the router, that's what I'm getting. wireless elsewhere in the house is ~30 mbps if I'm lucky. It varies greatly based on other factors such as neigbors wi-fi usage because it could cause interferance.
