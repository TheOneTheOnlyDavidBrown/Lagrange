[**ng-poly**](https://github.com/dustinspecker/generator-ng-poly) - *Yeoman scaffolding tool for Angular applications*
* Fixed a few issues I found that decreased work-flow speed and added some improvements such as better notification to the developers.

[**Satellizer**](https://github.com/sahat/satellizer) - *Angular JWT authentication tool*
* Fixed bug preventing the users from using localStorage to save the token
* Added feature to allow the developer to toggle session and local storage for “remember me” options.
* Added support for non-English characters and unit tests for the changes.

[**angular-toastr**](https://github.com/Foxandxss/angular-toastr) - *Angular notification library*
* Noticed there was no documentation about closing a notification so I dug into the
source code to add it only to find that the functionality already existed. This
prompted me to add the instructions to the documentation.

[**Front-end Master’s Front-end Handbook**](https://github.com/FrontendMasters/front-end-handbook)
* Proposed section on scaffolding tools which was added shortly after.
