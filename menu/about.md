title: About
---
I am a quick learning software engineer with experience in front-end development using **AngularJS**, **Backbone**, and **jQuery**, and back-end experience in **Node.js** and **Ruby on Rails**.
I've been the sole developer on small projects and I've collaborated with large teams while architecting and developing scalable and maintainable applications for Fortune 50 companies.

I emphasize testing in my development because I believe it creates better code faster.

Contact me for 1-on-1 consultations.
