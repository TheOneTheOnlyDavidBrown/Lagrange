I am a quick learning software engineer with experience in front-end development using  **Angular 2+**, **NgRx**, **AngularJS**, **VueJS**, **Backbone**, and **jQuery**, and back-end experience in **Node.js** and **Ruby on Rails**.

I've been the sole developer on small projects and I've collaborated with large teams while architecting and developing scalable and maintainable applications for Fortune 50 companies. I've worked in numerous industries writng software for healthcare apps, video streaming apps, mapping tools, and scheduling apps,

I emphasize testing in my development because I believe it creates better code faster.
